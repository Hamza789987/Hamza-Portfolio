# Hamza-Portfolio

- **Biography/Self-Intro** - a paragraph or two about you.
- **Tech Stack** - the languages/technologies that you have experience with.
- **Education / Experience** - only those that are relevant to coding / the line of work you want to go into.
- **Projects** - sites/apps that you have built.
  - You should aim to have at least 3 and no more than 5 projects to showcase.
  - Try to add as much variety to the projects you choose as possible.
  - Include a short description of what it does; the tech you used; and a link to the GitHub repo.
  - EITHER include a link to the deployed online version OR add screenshots, short clips, GIFs, etc. of a
    localhost version from your computer.
  - Avoid including exercises from the course or apps built from tutorials.
  - Challenges from the course could be included as these involved less guidance but having something unique would
    still be better to help you stand out from the crowd.
  - You will also have time to build and add more later!
