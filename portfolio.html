        Hi my name is Hamza Ahmed and i am a junior entry-level front-end
        developer! i began my learning for web design after i completed sixth
        form in which i realised after studying Information Technology that
        coding and designing websites would be an enjoyable enthusiastic career
        to have for a job to work in.
      </div>
      <div>
        The languages i chose to learn for front-end development was Html, Css,
        JavaScript and React and i soon plan to learn Tailwind as i only do
        front-end development and web-design to strengthen my skills for design
        and boost my creativity
      </div>
      <div>
        The course/bootcamp i stuck to and loved was Boolean which is an online
        full-time study course allowing me to learn the content in the first
        half of the day and putting what we learnt to practice with pairs for
        team-work and to also learn from each other. Along with that we were
        able to also have the ability to do individual work when getting to the
        end of a module which is a challenge to challenge everything what we
        learnt for the entire module
      </div>
      <div>
        The projects i have made are categorised into 3 and within i have so far
        made 2 in each:
        <ol>
          <li>Social media clones</li>
          <li>E-commerce</li>
