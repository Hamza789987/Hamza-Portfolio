          As for my final 2 projects, these were made from languages I will most
          likely will use for my career in web-design/front-end development;
          which is React. this is a JavaScript library which allows JavaScript
          to be much more efficient in the browser than plain old JavaScript
          Dom. In here I decided to do a cohort dashboard to implement my React
          skills with the use of APIs, routing, useEffect etc.

          And i'd thought to leave the best one last which is my Tic Tac
          Toe/Noughts and Crosses game which I was pleased to make with a
          stylish background and fun to play with others at your own make of a
          game. In the future i plan to make a lot more individual projects to
          practice my skills and explore a lot more of React and using it to
          practice real-world projects allowing me to advance and master the
          skills i have learnt and have more experience in React
